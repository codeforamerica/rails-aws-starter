    <h1>Atoms</h1>
    <p class="text--help">Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. Applied to web interfaces, atoms are our HTML tags, such as a form label, an input or a button.</p>
    <p class="text--help">Atoms can also include more abstract elements like color palettes, fonts and even more invisible aspects of an interface like animations.</p>
    <p class="text--help">Like atoms in nature they’re fairly abstract and often not terribly useful on their own. However, they’re good as a reference in the context of a pattern library as you can see all your global styles laid out at a glance.</p>
